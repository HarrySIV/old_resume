         <h3>Welcome to my website! The purpose of this website is to showcase my ability as a developer and the progress I achieve. Please, if you have any feedback, do not hesitate to contact me. 
            <br><br>
            I originally went to college with the intent on acquiring a Bachelor's in Engineering, and therefore have taken quite a few math and engineering classes over the years. 
            However, during the pandemic, I stopped pursuing a college degree for the meantime in order to learn various languages and become a developer. 
            <br><br>
            I find myself passionate about learning coding and enjoy applying myself and building projects and websites. I do intend to continue my education, 
            although I believe a Bachelor's and perhaps a Masters in Computer Science is in my future. I have learned so much as I am a fast and flexible learner, 
            and fully intend to master many different languages in hopes of eventually becoming a full-stack developer. 
            <br><br>
            If I choose to accept a position you offer, I can garuntee that I will regualarly impress you with my progress. There is nothing I love more than a good challenge. 
            Thank you for taking the time to read about myself, and I hope to work with you in the future!
